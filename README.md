This project allows you to navigate through a simple model of our solar system. Each of the planets (including Pluto) follows an elliptical orbit around the sun based on real-life
measurements of their orbits' eccentricities. Each planet's axis of rotation is tilted to reflect their real-life axial tilts. Earths moon also orbits the Earth and rotates on its
own axis. Sizes, distances, and linear and angular speeds are not to scale.
